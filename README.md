# Finding-the-Right-Book
This project is about creating class objects that are able to read books and then perform analysis on them. The analysis performed will provide insight towards basic data science. The first task is about cleaning a dataset, the second and third tasks are about performing calculations on a dataset, and the fourth is about presenting your results. The dataset consists of books selected from the Project Guttenberg. These books are encoded in UTF-8 and are written in English.
